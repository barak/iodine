iodine for Debian
-----------------

* Warning: both the client and the server needs to use the same protocol
  version; in practice that means that the 0.4.x, 0.5.x, and 0.6.x packages
  are not compatible!

* Please note that iodine(d) needs the tun kernel module.
* Instruction for setting up the infrastructure (including delegating a new
  subdomain) are included in /usr/share/doc/iodine/README and in iodined(8).
* /usr/sbin/iodine-client-start is a script for setting up a tunnel and
  routing through it from the client side.
