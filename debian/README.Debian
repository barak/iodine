iodine for Debian
-----------------

* Please note that iodine(d) needs the tun kernel module.
* Please note that iodine expects the same version on the server and the client.
* Instruction for setting up the infrastructure (including delegating a new
  subdomain) are included in /usr/share/doc/iodine/README and in iodined(8).
* /usr/share/doc/iodine/examples contains an example script for setting up a
  tunnel and routing through it from the client side.
