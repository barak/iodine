iodine (0.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - hides password from ps and stdin (closes: #432719).
    - uses /etc/resolv.conf (closes: #432867).
    - incorporates patch to daemonize before chrooting and dropping
      privileges, therefore dropping 02_detach.dpatch.
    - uses $(MAKE) in Makefile, except in one case, therefore adding patch
      02_make.dpatch.
    - fixes the install dir for the manpage, therefore adapting patch
      01_mandir.dpatch.
  * debian/copyright: update years of copyright.
  * debian/rules: use $(DPATCH_STAMPFN) and $@.
  * Mention (improved) manpage in README.Debian.
