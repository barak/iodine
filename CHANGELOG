		Needs TUN/TAP driver: http://www.whiteboard.ne.jp/~admin2/tuntap/
		Still needs some more code in tun.c for opening/closing the device
	- Added option in server (-c) to disable IP/port checking on each packet,
		will hopefully help when server is behind NAT

		Should remove the need for the -c option and also work with
		bugfixed DNS servers worldwide.

		info about each RX/TX datagram.
